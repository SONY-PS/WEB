<p>Earth (1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi) from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to 
have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist.
Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. 
Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.
It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.</p>

<h1>SUN</h2>
<p>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. 
Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[59] which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,
[60] produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into 
helium, making it a main-sequence star.[61] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly
 radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.[62]</p>
